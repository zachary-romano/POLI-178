## The purpose of your homework is to practice manipulating objects and learning their structures

## If you know what a package is,  Do NOT install any packages. Only use base R. 

## If you get stuck, Google it or ask the message board. 

###### Task 1: Generating vectors:

#1a  Create a vector  "a" that runs from -6 to 6 in 0.5 increments. 
    # so -6, -5.5, -5, -4.5 ... 5.5, 6. 
  ### Please do not just write it out. 
a <- seq(-6, 6, by = 0.5)


#1b. Create a vector "b" that is the vector a repeated 3 times. 
b <- rep(a, times = 3)


##### 2. Exploring vectors: 

# For vector "b" tell me the: 
# class
class(b)
# Mean 
mean(b)
# how many elements are in it. 
length(b)

####### 3. Manipulating vectors:

# 3.1 Starting with vector b, create a vector "c" the is only the elements "0, 0.5, 1, 1.5"
c <- b[13:16]

# 3.2 Here is a vector: 
vec_1 <- c(5,7,9, "apples", "bananas", "apples", 5, 2, 8)

# 3.2.1 What is it's class?
class(vec_1)

# 3.2.2 Please provide a table that summarizes the frequency of elements in the vector.
table(vec_1)

# 3.2.3 Without referring to a specific index, reduce the vector to the numbers. 
vec_2 <- as.numeric(vec_1) # Make new vector that keeps all numeric values of vec_1, make the rest NAs
vec_2 <- vec_2[!is.na(vec_2)] # Remove all NAs in the vector
print(vec_2) # Print the vector with only numbers

############## 4. Dataframes and logical operators. 

# 4.1 Referencing only vec_1, create a data.frame with three columns and three rows. 
# The title for each column should read: "number", "fruit", "score" 
# Each column should include elements 1-3, 4-6, 7-9 respectively. 
number <- vec_1[1:3] # Save elements 1-3 as vector named "number"
fruit <- vec_1[4:6] # Save elements 4-6 as vector named "fruit"
score <- vec_1[7:9] # Save elements 7-9 as vector named "score"

df <- data.frame(number, fruit, score) # Make dataframe with the three vectors as columns

# 4.2 Create a new column called "apples". Make apples equal to 1 if the fruit is an apple, and 0 otherwise.
df$apples <- ifelse(df$fruit == "apples", 1, 0)

# 4.3 Create another column called plenty_apples equal to 1 if the fruit is an apple, and the number is more than 7.  
df$plenty_apples <- ifelse(df$fruit == "apples" & df$number > 7, 1, 0)

## 4.4 Subset the dataframe so that we only have rows where plenty_apples = 1. 
plenty_apples_df <- subset(df, df$plenty_apples == 1)
