# 1.  takes in two intigers and adds them together. 



#2. Write a function that takes in a dataframe and returns a vector of column names if and only if the column is numeric. 


# In this sample frame, it should return v1, v2
#dat <- data.frame(v1=1:20,v2=11:30 ,v3=letters[1:20])


#2.1, add an error message to your function. That is, if you input any object other than a dataframe or a tibble, it returns a Message. "Error. You must input a tibble or dataframe."




# 3 Sometimes we get dates and they come in different formats. Let's say that you employ two data entry staff who enter dates as character strings. 
#Some enter them in format:  01/31/2001. Others  enter in format Jan-31-2001. 

# Write a function that takes in a character string, determines if it is one of these two formats. If it is, output the date. If it is not in one of these formats, output an NA. 
# So if we input either   01/31/2001 or Jan-31-2001, it would output a date for Jan 31 2001.
